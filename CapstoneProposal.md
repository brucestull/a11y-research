## Project Overview

### My interests in this project
* I believe that it is not only important to ensure web applications are accessible but also that literal access to the internet and information is critical.
### Questions or Goals of Organization
* Access to high speed internet is not always an option to users. It's important that some of the fundamental operation of this app not require high speed internet.
* What have been effective ways to provide internet access to areas with low-bandwidth access?
* What have been effective ways to provide internet access to homeless individuals?
* Compatability with mobile website.
* What have been effective training methods for digital literacy?
* This app will provide a way to store the following:

* Alternative navigation of application.
* Add page for access to one external api. API to be determined.
* CSV, pdf, spreadsheet... - How to store these?
* Show side and/or top nave even when main content is scrolled up/down.
