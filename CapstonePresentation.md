# Words to say:

## My motivation for this project.
- [ ] I've felt overwhelmed when seeing a lot of information presented.
- [ ] I've been a technology instructor for veterans with various disabilities and always endeavored to help them overcome their obstacles to technology access. Whether it be physical or cognative disabilities.
- [ ] Even homeless military vetarans and the general homeless population.
- [ ] I've felt overwhelmed when some technology didn't act as I expected it to.

## What problem does it solve?
- [ ] I want to provide an application to store research data and resource links for researchers and administrators to use to make decisions on how best to allocate resources to provide both physical access to technology as well as finding ways to improve current accessibility methodologies. There is always a non-equal balance which needs to be made between designing technology for accessiblity and  the need for some user training. I'd like to see if we can make some shifts to better designs for accessiblity so users don't have a large burden of learning how to use a device to get the information they need to enrich their lives.
- [ ] My app will provide a way to store and retrieve this data.
- [ ] It's also notable that this app will be accessible itself so there will be less limits to who can use this it.
- [ ] The beginning is a way for users to store links and notes to their URLs.

## What major obstacles were encountered and how were they overcome?
- [ ] I have an extreme difficulty understanding by reading. I do better doing and experimenting. This process was a challenge since it seemed like I either chose to or had to spend time reading to understand some of these concepts and it still didn't seem to make whole lot of sense until I started trying to implement these concepts. I have a long way to go.

## My development process?
- [ ] Part of my development process is doing things repeatedly while making small changes to statements or functions to understand what each little part does. I Have difficulty understanding documentation so I spend time playing around with the new concept I'm learning until it makes sense.

## How did my vision change over the course of the project?
- [ ] My vision is similar to beginning.
- [ ] The main vision change was making this app accessible in itself. I originally didn't think about making the app itself accessible, I just wanted to provide a structure for storing data and analyses. Thanks for the great discussion, Liz.

## What part did I like most/least?

## What is the future of the project?
- [ ] My goal is to create a non-profit which does these things I've discussed and improves the lives of individuals which currently don't have adequate access to technology.


# Demonstration

## Prep for demonstration
- [x] Use Chrome, hide bookmark bar.
- [x] Desktop view, not mobile view.
- [ ] Ensure user is logged out of app.
- [x] Opened tabs:
    - [x] [CSS and JavaScript accessibility best practices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/CSS_and_JavaScript)
    - [x] [TAP Project Board](https://github.com/brucestull/technology-and-perceptibility/projects/2)
- [ ] Active tab is TAP Project Board

## Home and login
- [ ] Select [Capstone presentation is completed](https://github.com/brucestull/technology-and-perceptibility/issues/190) card, 'In Progress' column.
- [ ] Open application link in new tab.
    * Backup: [Technology and Perceptibility](https://technology-and-perceptibility.herokuapp.com/)
- [ ] Landing page in progress. Want to add some content which anonymous user can view.
- [ ] Talk about using 'Tab' key to navigate is important for keyboard users and other Accessible Technologies, like switches and such.
- [ ] Point out border used to show which element has focus for individuals with low vision and/or users of screen magnification.
- [ ] Move 'Tab' around then select and activate 'Sign Up'.
- [ ] Tab through 'Sign Up' elements.
- [ ] Point out that the focus indicator isn't interfering with input labels.
- [ ] Select and activate 'Home'.
- [ ] Select and activate 'Log In'.
- [ ] Log in.
- [ ] 'Tab' to and activate 'Skip to main content'.
- [ ] Show 'Tab' works.
- [ ] 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text and background is required for AA. My minimum was about 5.47. PERCEIVABLE
- [ ] My font choice is almost okay. I recently learned about some better choices so will impliment them after Capstone presentation. So will do more research on web-safe fonts and provide fallback fonts as well. ROBUST
- [ ] I used Adobe Color's Accessibility tools to find a color theme that has both reasonable contrast and is color-blind-safe.
- [ ] Try to avoid horizontal scrolling requirements.
    - [ ] So I made the app responsive.
    - [ ] Do a quick narrow display view.
    - [ ] Back to desktop view.

## Use and edit existing link
- [ ] Clink link for 'POUR - The Four WCAG Principles'.
    - [ ] Perceivable
    - [ ] Operable
    - [ ] Understandable
    - [ ] Robust

- [ ] Back to app page.
- [ ] Click on 'View details for this item' for 'POUR - The Four WCAG Principles'.
- [ ] Click 'Edit this item'.
- [ ] Add paragraph to end of 'Link Notes' string.
- [ ] Click 'Save Changes'.
- [ ] Show 'Link Notes' have changed.
- [ ] Click 'Home'.
